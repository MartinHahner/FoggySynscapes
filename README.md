## Semantic Understanding of Foggy Scenes with Purely Synthetic Data

Forked from [github.com/sakaridis/fog_simulation-SFSU_synthetic][foggy_cityscapes_code].  
Adapted by [Martin Hahner][profile] at the Computer Vision Lab of ETH Zurich.


### Introduction

This is the source code we used in our ITSC 2019 paper titled  
[**Semantic Understanding of Foggy Scenes with Purely Synthetic Data**][website],  
to create ***Foggy Synscapes***, a foggy version of the original [*Synscapes*][synscapes] dataset.  

<img src="https://github.com/MartinHahner88/FoggySynscapes/blob/main/data/readme/preview.gif" alt="foggy_images" width="300"/>  

The pipeline computes transmittance maps,  
which can be combined with the original clear-weather image  
to obtain foggy versions of the clear-weather image.


### Pipeline Overview

<img src="https://github.com/MartinHahner88/FoggySynscapes/blob/main/data/readme/pipeline.png" alt="pipeline"/>


### Getting Started

This demo runs our fog simulation pipeline on an example clear-weather image from *Synscapes* and writes the results to `./output/demo/`. 


#### Requirements

-  **MATLAB**  
    The code has been developed in MATLAB R2018b and tested in MATLAB 2019a, too.


#### How to run the demo    

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MartinHahner88/FoggySynscapes.git
   ```
2. Go to MATLAB's Command Window and assign `FOG_SIMULATION_ROOT` to the path you have cloned this repository into
   ```
   FOG_SIMULATION_ROOT = '/path/to/FoggySynscapes';
   ```
3. Change MATLAB's current folder
   ```
   cd(fullfile(FOG_SIMULATION_ROOT, 'source'));
   ```
4. Run [Demo.m](source/Demo.m)
   ```
   Demo;
   ```


### Generating *Foggy Synscapes* all by yourself

Due to the [license agreement][synscapes_license] of the [*Synscapes*][synscapes] dataset,  
we unfortunatelly cannot directly distribute ***Foggy Synscapes***.  

**But** if you follow the instructions below, you can reproduce ***Foggy Synscapes*** all by yourself. \*  

\* given you have access to the original [*Synscapes*][synscapes] dataset


#### Requirements

-  ***Synscapes***  
    You need the original dataset as a starting point.

-  **Python**  
    The code has been developed and tested using Python 3.7.4.

-  **MATLAB**  
    The code has been developed in MATLAB R2018b and tested in MATLAB 2019a, too.


#### How to reproduce *Foggy Synscapes*:

1. Request the original [*Synscapes*][synscapes] dataset by sending a kind [email to the authors][synscapes_mail].

2. Then you need to convert the *.exr* depth files provided by the *Synscapes* dataset to *.mat* depth files that are compatible to our fog simulation pipeline. You can do this for example by using the provided [exr_to_mat.py](source/Depth_processing/exr_to_mat.py) python script.
   
3. Finally, you can modify [FoggySynscapes.m](source/FoggySynscapes.m) according to your needs and generate your own version of   
***Foggy Synscapes***.

**Note:** In our paper we used *beta* values of [0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.06].
